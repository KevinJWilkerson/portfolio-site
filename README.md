# Portfolio Website Project

For this project, we were tasked with building a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. The site is intended to be updated as we complete additional projects, but for now only features a link to our other completed project, namely a code refactor project. Requirements for this project included that the site:
- Include our name and either a headshot or avatar image
- Incorporates a navigation bar with working links to each section of the page
- Includes a section to highlight any completed applications, including their title and a link to the deployed application on github
- Uses media queries to provide responsive design across screen sizes

The current site will be updated as additional projects are finished, and potentially refactored with more advanced CSS or coding libraries.
